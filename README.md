# Memoize

#### An application for practicing Javascript Array Prototypes. Sometimes you just need to test your knowledge and this is the perfect way to do that!

### Installation Steps

```git clone https://github.com/geet084/memoize.git```

```npm install```

```npm start```

#### Background/About

#### This project was the final one of the module and was implemented as a solo endeavor. This was to showcase our knowledge of react and further solidify the concepts of Test Driven Development, React, Sass, and API fetching from Heroku. For this project we were asked to create a dataset which would be used for the API endpoint, and to implement a testing suite
